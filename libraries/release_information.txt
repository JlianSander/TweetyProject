15.07.2019 - TweetyProject 1.13
  New libraries:
    - net.sf.tweety.arg.rankings: ranking-based semantics for abstract
      argumentation frameworks
  New functionalities:
    - New ranking-based semantics for abstract argumentation
      (net.sf.tweety.arg.rankings): burden-based semantics, discussion-based
      semantics, categorizer ranking semantics, social argumentation ranking
      semantics, tuples ranking semantics.
    - added several postulates for ranking-based semantics for abstract
      argumentation (net.sf.tweety.arg.rankings); automatic evaluation through
      postulate evaluation framework (net.sf.tweety.commons.postulates).
    - Added implementation of ADFs (net.sf.tweety.arg.adf), in particular
      reasoner for model, naive, and admissible semantics and parser for
      the k++ ADF format.
  Minor changes:
    - Refactored the use of signatures in logics; signature is now an
      attribute in commons.BeliefSet
    - added more postulates for inconsistency measures for propositional
      logic (net.sf.tweety.logics.pl.postulates); automatic evaluation through
      postulate evaluation framework (net.sf.tweety.commons.postulates).
    - Belief base iteration from text files (with one belief base per line)
23.01.2019 - TweetyProject 1.12
  New libraries:  <none>
  New functionalities:
    - Complete ASP library overhaul (net.sf.tweety.lp.asp); added support for
      ASPCore2 input syntax; added more solvers and tests
    - Complete DL library overhaul (net.sf.tweety.logics.dl); added syntax and
      semantic classes, and parser
    - Added writer for ASPIC files (net.sf.tweety.arg.aspic.writer.AspicWriter)
    - Added new reasoner for ASPIC
      (net.sf.tweety.arg.aspic.reasoner.DirectionalReasoner)
    - Added (naive) algorithm to compute betweenness centrality in graphs
  Minor changes:
    - Added further postulates for automatic postulate evaluation of
      inconsistency measures (net.sf.tweety.logics.pl.postulates)
    - Refactored inference modes for all reasoners (see
      net.sf.tweety.commons.InferenceMode)
    - Performance improvements for DeLP reasoner
      (net.sf.tweety.arg.delp.reasoner.DelpReasoner)
    - Overhauled examples for ASPIC (net.sf.tweety.arg.aspic.examples)
    - Bugfixes probo reasoner (net.sf.tweety.arg.dung.reasoner.ProboReasoner)
    - Unified naming of brute-force/naive reasoners (all are now prefixed by
      "Simple")
    - general bugfixing

24.07.2018 - TweetyProject 1.11
  New libraries:  <none>
  New functionalities:
    - Approximative reasoning for ASPIC+ (arg.aspic.reasoner.RandomAspicReasoner)
    - TPTP format support in logics.fol; added support for equality
    - Added classes for automatic postulate evaluation (see commons.postulates
      for the framework and logics.pl.postulates for an example)
    - Added a new graded semantics for abstract argumentation (see
      arg.prob.reasoner.ProbabilisticRankingReasoner)
    - Added a simple DPLL implementation in Java in logics.pl
    - Added Dimacs parser in logics.pl
  Minor changes:
    - commons.Reasoner interface refactored; added additional interfaces
      commons.QualitativeReasoner and commons.QuantativeReasoner;
      removed obsolete commons.BeliefBaseReasoner, commons.Answer
      and others
    - folder "projects" is now folder "libraries"
    - logics.lp.asp bugfixes and stream-lining
    - logics.fol bugfixes and stream-lining
    - removed arg.simpledeductive library, integrated functionalities into
      net.sf.tweety.arg.deductive
    - almost every library comes now with an "examples" package containing
      example code
    - general bugfixing
