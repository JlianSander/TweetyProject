1. WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains subfolders for all TweetyProject libraries. These subfolders
contain the source and Maven project files of the TweetyProject libraries.

2. IMPORTING TWEETY INTO ECLIPSE WITH MAVEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Setting up Eclipse and Maven:
A version >= Indigo of Eclipse has to be installed. Download Eclipse 
from https://www.eclipse.org/ if needed.
If the Eclipse package for Java-Developers is used, then the Maven plugin m2e is
already installed. Otherwise it has to be installed from the Indigo or Juno
release update site, choose:
"Collaboration --> m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse"
Also check "Maven --> Installations" in the Eclipse preferences dialog and use 
your external Maven installation.

2.2 Importing Maven Projects into Eclipse:
If the Maven integration for Eclipse is installed, one can select
"Import -> Existing Maven Projects" from the Eclipse UI.
When selecting the project folder of your local working copy of Tweety,
the listbox should show every TweetyProject library.
Before clicking on "Finish", select "Advanced" and use the name template
'[groupId].[artifactId]'

3.1 Common errors:
If errors occur, try right-clicking on a library in your package explorer
and choosing: "Maven -> Update Project...".

3.2. License comment:
The Tweety license comment should be the header comment of all class files. 
To have Eclipse add it automatically to newly created files, go to 
Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Code Templates. 
In the "Comments" tab, edit the "Files" pattern to contain the following:

/*
